# Deception Detection In virtual sales meetings
How can deception be detected in digital conversations? Our project explores AI-powered methods for automated deception detection—for example, in video conferences, sales calls, or online surveys. Unlike traditional lie detectors, we focus on non-contact, unobtrusive techniques suitable for everyday situations.

To support this, we are building a new video dataset specifically designed for economic experiments. The goal is to analyze human deception in realistic but voluntary contexts—such as exaggerated product claims. Alongside classic tools like OpenFace, we compare modern deep learning models and study how people respond to automated deception detection.

This interdisciplinary project bridges Deep Learning, classical Machine Learning, and experimental economics — without relying on psychological modeling — aiming to promote fairer digital interactions in the long run.
