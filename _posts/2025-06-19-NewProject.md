## The follow-up project has been approved

<!-- ![image](/deception/assets/theme/images/mindmap_diagnostik_linked.svg)    href does not work unless image opened in new tab  -->

We are happy to announce the launch of our follow-up project 638/13-3, funded by the DFG (grant number: 468478819).

In this new phase, we will expand the dataset by introducing varying payout schemes to evaluate how incentives influence behavior and observable cues of deception.
In addition, we aim to explore new modalities for deception detection, such as camera-based vital signs, thermal imaging, and hand gesture analysis.
We will also investigate whether methods from related domains—such as depression detection or pain monitoring—can be adapted to improve deception detection accuracy.
